In the assignment you are asked to build such a communication system with support for
multimedia content using java 8, in which the information we want to
transmit is either video, photo, or text from one or more
users in a crowd of many subscribers. Due to the large number of
users we want to serve, we need to implement a smart
system, which will be able to transfer appropriately and to the appropriate people
recipients of the relevant content. To share with users this
information, we need to know who is interested in it
(subscribers), how they can express interest in her (topic subscription)
and how they can get it. This information will be transferred appropriately from
the system you are being asked to implement so that users can see it
content as soon as it becomes available in the system.
The development of the system will allow you to become familiar with the concept of a
of such an Instant Messaging system, as well as by getting to know the environment
Android. For your convenience, the development of this system will be done
‚óè The phase concerns the implementation of the multimedia streaming Framework
(Event Delivery System) that will be responsible for supporting the promotion
and downloading (streaming) multimedia data (video, photos and
text).
